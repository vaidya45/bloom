## About Bloom

Bloom is a platform designed to help University of Maryland students track course seat availability in real time. It was created to simplify the process of monitoring course openings, eliminating the need for constant manual checks.

## Testing a Course (Existing in the Database)

To test the functionality, input "CMSC451" into the search field to check seat availability.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
